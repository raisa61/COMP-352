For the recursive function, if we reach a character which is *, 
we replace the * with either 1 or 0 and increase the index by 1, 
so that it can traverse through the whole string and look for * chars,
in the end, we do backtracking to make sure we did not miss any possible 
combination. The base case is when the index will be of the same length
of the input string, meaning that we have reached the end of the string.

From the track_recursive.txt file, we can see that as we increase the number
of *, the time keeps increasing. We can see from the track records that it is 
not a linear increase, the time is not constant and it's not logarithmic or factorial
either. So we are left with the exponential function. And from the record, we can tell
that the time complexity which matches the most with our algorithm is, O(2^n).
As for the space complexity the recursive calls happen linerlay (n is the maximum depth of recursion tree generated) that's why 
the complexity of space is O(n).

For the iterative function, we decided to use stack, we push the input string in 
the stack, then we enter the loop and pop the string for processing it. This stack is the reason why we have space
complexity of O(n). We use another loop to check if the input string has a * char, if it does, we process the 
input string accordingly and push it to the stack. It's good to note that push and pop both take constant (O(1)) time.

From the track_loop.txt file, again, based on the same reason stated above, 
the time complexity of this algorithm is, O(2^n)

If we try to compare both of the algorithms' complexities, we can see that both of them have
the same time complexity, which is O(2^n). Both also have the same space complexity O(n).
