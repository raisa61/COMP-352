Priority queue using heap==>

TIME COMPLEXITY:
The time complexity of a heap is O(nlogn). Where n is the number of the elements and logn is the height of the heap.

Omega is logn.

SPACE COMPLEXITY:

We let n denote the number of entries in the priority queue at the time an operation
is executed. The space requirement is O(n). 


Priority queue using linked positional list==>

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n^2) since pq's complexity is n and we multiply that by the number of jobs n so it will be n^2

Omega is logn

SPACE COMPLEXITY:

We let n denote the number of entries in the list at the time an operation
is executed. The space requirement is O(n).
